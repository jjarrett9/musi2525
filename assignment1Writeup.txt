Assignment 1: Sinusoidals

The code is located in the Repo, each as an individual .m file. 

2b: Root, Root, Major Second, Major Third, Root, Major Third, Major Second, Fifth, Root, Root, Major Second, Major Third, Root

2c: If you wanted to start the melody a major third higher at c#, your startFrequency would
    be 554

Bonus: The sudden starting and ending of sound causes the clicks. This could be resolved by
       crossfading the end of one sinusoid and the begining of the next.
